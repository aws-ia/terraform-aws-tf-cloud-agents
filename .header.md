# Terraform Cloud Agent on Amazon ECS

This solution creates self-hosted HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Terraform agent on Amazon ECS cluster. HCP Terraform allows you to manage isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure using self-hosted HCP Terraform agents. The agent polls HCP Terraform or HCP Terraform Enterprise for any changes to your configuration and executes the changes locally, so you do not need to allow public ingress traffic to your resources. Agents allow you to control infrastructure in private environments without modifying your network perimeter.
